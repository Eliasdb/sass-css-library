# Octane CSS library

## About

A small css library I have called Octane to learn concepts of SASS such as

- mixins, loops, functions, @use, @forward, @debug, @extend @include, sass:math

and to get my feet wet using Next.js for the first time.

Also made a small demo page with the classes I made with SASS.

## Used tech

- Next 13
- SASS

## Script to run locally

`npm i && npm run dev`

Note: Still need to purge unused CSS classes!
